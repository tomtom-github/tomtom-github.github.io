## Plot

* In the 29th century, rampant consumerism and environmental neglect have turned Earth into a garbage-strewn wasteland. Humanity is nowhere to be found, having been evacuated by the megacorporation Buy-N-Large (BnL) on giant starliners seven centuries earlier. 
* Of all the robotic trash compactors left by BnL to clean up, only one remains operational: a Waste Allocation Load-Lifter: Earth Class, or WALL-E. 
* One day, WALL-E's routine is broken by the arrival of an unmanned probe carrying an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator or EVE, sent to scan the planet for plant life. 
* WALL-E is smitten by the sleek, otherworldly robot, but she goes into standby when he shows her his most recent find: a living seedling. 
* The probe returns to collect EVE and the plant, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner Axiom.
